Now to those people in Chennai who are in need of a stay for the next 2-3 days away from the floods happening across Tamilnadu as we speak, you are most invited to head up to any of the hill stations. As a hotelier here, I am willing to accommodate all those in distress to stay at my hotel. Only for basic food you will have to pay. Stay is free up till Sunday the 6th December 2015 as I believe according to weather reports, havoc rains are going to lash out for the next 48 hours. Any form of relief required for anyone in distress because of the floods, please do not hesitate to call on the numbers below and I shall make necessary arrangements here in Kodaikanal. Also A request to every other hotelier out there to do the same.\nStaying up in the hills is safer even though it happens to be rainy season across. As far as Kodaikanal is concerned, nature has lashed out and moved on. It is safer than being down in the flooded cities.\nNote - To those of who see this as a free stay-vacation please ask your conscious if it is the right thing to do.
